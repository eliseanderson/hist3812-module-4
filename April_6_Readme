Hello!
So due to having to wait for my 3d print to be ready, I only have part of the work for the module done today. Basically anything that I felt I needed the final result for I'm waiting on, the rest I have posted today. To make it easier for you and me, I decided to make a running list.

Today:
Process Notes Part 1 - Aka I will add more later once the product is completed
Hypothesis 
Rubric - I made my own rubric, although I may change it depending on what happens

After:
Pictures of 3d Print - obviously
Paradata - I started it today, but after working on it I felt I couldnt finish it properly without knowing the end result
Process Notes part 2 

As of right now, my 3d print should be finished Monday, so I expect to be done everything Tuesday (unless of course I have to reprint). 
Can't wait to see how this turns out!
