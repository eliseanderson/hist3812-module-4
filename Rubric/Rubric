Once again, I didn't grade myself, but I did rewrite the rubric according to what I think is important. 
I may change it after I get my 3d print back, but for now:

/8 Process Notes - Am I insane for making my process notes worth almost half of my module? Maybe... But for this module I found the process
  of particular importance. I spent a lot of time thinking of how to approach this module in a meaningful way, trying different things that
  didn't work, and improving my 3d model. Lots of, as we said, "invisible labor" went into this module in particular and thus giving the 
  my process notes a lot of the points is my way of having that acknowledged.
  
/5 Paradata - See process notes points. I felt like reflecting on why this should be returned to a physical form is just as important 
  as the actual physical print for this one. 
  
/5 3d Print Object - I have no idea how this is going to turn out, but of course the physical form of my work is going to be important. 
  Unlike module 3 though, since I'm not physically hand carving it or anything Ive made it less marks. 

/2 Hypothesis - Hypothesis here for hypothesis sake.

Thank you!
